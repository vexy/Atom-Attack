# Atom Attack 1.5
Funny and simple game made entirely **Swift 5**. It is meant to be and exercise of both `SpriteKit` and `SceneKit`, with the emphasis on the first one.

Your goal is to collect as many Atoms as possible in order to upgrade your Core. Try to avoid Atoms that are _different_, yet catch as many of the _same_ Atoms as you can.

Have fun and Enjoy :)

Atom Attack was made using `SpriteKit` framework. Separate game entities are responsible for their drawing and motion actions, while game leveling logic is spread through scene, mainly inside `update(...)` method of the `SKSceneDelegate`. 

Stack:
  - Swift 5
  - iOS 13.1
